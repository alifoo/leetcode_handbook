# leetcode_handbook
A place to quickly check my past leetcode solutions

## Why create a backup repo?

Sometimes I want to remember how I solved a specific problem. For me, it's easier to grep my solutions locally than opening the leetcode website. Also, having them stored in Github give me motivation to do more and more.

### Date marks

- 03/06/2025. Starting the repo! I tried doing leetcode 10 months ago but it was not the time for me. From now on, i'm going to use this to become at least 1% better in programming every single day.
